## AI Samples
Contains several examples of code I wrote for my Intro to Artificial Intelligence course. `AIPlayer.java` is from a group project, though that file was primarily my work. The full project was an extended version of tic-tac-toe, which had an AI player that could compete with a human player. `Robot.java` was an individual project I completed; the skeleton was provided by the teaching staff and all of the algorithms were implemented by me. The goal of this program was to help a robot navigate a simulated grid map in the most optimal way. `Futoshiki.java` is a program designed to solve a Futoshiki puzzle (a Japanese logic puzzle similar to Soduku).

## Bomb Game Sample
Some code samples from the game I've been working on in my spare time, as well as a playable demo.

## Group 7 - HCI
A Figma file of the wireframe my group designed in my Human-Computer Interaction course for the NC Parks and Recreation vehicle inventory management webpage.

## Wordlist.c
From a project in my C class to read a list of words from a file and store them.


Additional projects, which I am unable to share publicly for various reasons, are available on request.
